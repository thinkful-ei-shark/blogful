# The Plan

Make a new express project called blogful-api.
Create a new database called blogful.
Make migrations to manage the creation of tables and relations.
Make seeding scripts to populate the tables with dummy data.
Copy the ArticlesService file into the new project.
Write the first endpoint for GET /articles using the ArticlesService.
Write express integration tests for GET /articles using both supertest and knex.
Write the other endpoints and tests for POST /articles and DELETE /articles/:article_id.
